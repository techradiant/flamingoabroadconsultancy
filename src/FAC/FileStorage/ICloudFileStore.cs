    /// The virtual file store uses forward slash (/) as the path delimiter, and has no concept of
    /// volumes or drives. All paths are specified and returned as relative to the root of the virtual
    /// file store. Absolute paths using a leading slash or leading period, and parent traversal
    /// using "../", are not supported.
    ///
    /// This abstraction does not dictate any case sensitivity semantics. Case sensitivity is left to
    /// the underlying storage system of concrete implementations. For example, the Windows file system
    /// is case insensitive, while Linux file system and Azure Blob Storage are case sensitive.
